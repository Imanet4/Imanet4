# Hi, I'm Imane 👋

I'm a junior full-stack web developer in training—  
Currently diving deep into the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

After years in customer service and operations,  
I shifted to tech for its pace, creativity, and challenge.  
My ADHD-brain thrives here. Constant learning. Endless problem-solving.
